A multi-agent AI application that blends deep document analysis with practical career skills, designed to be the ultimate study partner for college students. Powered by LangGraph, Google Gemini, and Qdrant.

---

## ‚ú® Project Vision

Standard study tools are often one-dimensional. DocuMentor is built on the idea that students need a holistic assistant that helps with both **academic revision** and **career-focused micro-learning**. This application combines a powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot for course notes with a suite of standalone AI agents for other essential tasks.

## üöÄ Core Features

*   **üß† Conversational RAG Agent:** Upload any PDF (lecture notes, research papers, textbooks) and have a deep, context-aware conversation. The agent remembers your chat history and uses a sophisticated LangGraph-powered workflow to decide whether to use the PDF's knowledge or its own.
*   **üí° Dynamic Skill Agent:** Get a unique, AI-generated micro-skill on demand. The agent is trained to provide relevant, college-level tips across three categories: Tech, Aptitude, and Soft Skills.
*   **üìÖ AI-Powered Study Planner:** Input your study duration and subjects, and the Planner Agent will generate a detailed, day-by-day revision schedule in a clean markdown table.
*   **üìù Interactive Quiz Agent:** Generate a 5-question multiple-choice quiz on any topic, either from a general knowledge base or based specifically on the content of your uploaded PDF.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project uses a modern, modular architecture with a separate backend and frontend.

*   **Backend:** FastAPI, LangGraph, LangChain
*   **Frontend:** Streamlit
*   **AI & ML:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash, Google Embeddings
